## Configuring the RPi
run `setup.sh` with sudo and everything should get nicely configured
`setup.sh` features three stages:
- Stage 1: Setting up the Raspberry Pi
- Stage 2: Downloading and installing Python 3.9.2
- Stage 3: Setting up the Python virtual environment

additional details can be found inside the script

setup.sh also requires a txt file that has the desired IP address on the local network
you want the RPI to try to obtain by default
