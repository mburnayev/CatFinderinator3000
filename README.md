# CatFinderinator3000
Fun little multifaceted project that uses a variety of technologies I've touched down on in the past and/or wanted to use.

## Project overview
This system is composed of a computer with a camera, an image segmentation model trained to detect calico cats, code on the computer that will record a video if the camera using the model detects a calico cat, more code that will push the recorded video to a database, and a user phone with an app that can retrieve uploaded videos from the database.

At the most abstracted level, this is a visualization of the project.

## Project Obstacles Breakdown
Obstacle | Notes | Resolved?
--- | --- | ---
Creating a foundation for an app that can display videos | - | ‚úÖ
Preliminary app testing  on Web | - | ‚úÖ
Preliminary app testing  on Android (2023) | Spent a lot of time amending Gradle and Kotlin files to use correct SDK versions and dependencies | ‚úÖ
Preliminary app testing on iOS | Spent around a week or two working with CocoaPods, got it to deploy on an iPad, then something stopped working. No more iOS development. | ‚ùé
Finding instructions on how to create a custom Tensorflow(lite) model | - | ‚úÖ 
Finding an instructive Google Colab on custom model training | Google created many TFLite Google Colabs back in 2021, sadly none of them worked in the cloud | ‚ùé
Installing the tflite-model-maker package | Couldn't do it because ScaNN is for x86 only, found a workaround using Kali Linux using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) | ‚úÖ
Training and Validating a TFLite model | The model wasn't very good, had 100% accuracy, see pictures below | üÜó
Installing OpenCV and Tensorflow for Python 3.7 (or 3.4, I forget) on the RPi 3 (2023) | Dependency hell is real and I won after several weeks | ‚úÖ
Deploying the model and inferencing | Crummy model produced crummy results. Also it ran at low single digit fps and detected nothing | üÜó


Installing OpenCV
