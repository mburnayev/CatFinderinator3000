# CatFinderinator3000
Fun(?) little multifaceted project that uses a variety of technologies I've touched down on in the past and/or wanted to use.

## Project overview
This system is comprised of 3 main components:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (with camera and machine learning model, and Python script making use of both)
- Firebase (for app authentication and database)
- Cross-platform application (written in Dart, using Flutter)

The systems starts with the RPi, which is trained to detect calico cats (or just my cat), which has a perpetually running Python script that will record a short video if my cat is detected in the live feed. Having recording the video, the script will push the recorded video to a database, which can then be accessed on any platform through an app I created that retrieves the recorded videos from the database.

Here is an abstracted visualization of the project that the above text describes. This needs to be updated...

## Project Obstacles Breakdown
Obstacle | Notes | Resolved?
--- | --- | ---
Create a foundation for an app that can display videos | - | ‚úÖ
Preliminary app testing on Web | - | ‚úÖ
Preliminary app testing on Android (2023) | Spent a lot of time amending Gradle and Kotlin files to use correct SDK versions and dependencies | ‚úÖ
Preliminary app testing on iOS | Spent almost two weeks working with CocoaPods, deployed it on an iPad, then something broke. No more iOS, too much headache| ‚ùé
Set up Firebase Authentication and Cloud Storage and configuring app to use it | Piece of cake, thanks Google | ‚úÖ
Find instructions on how to create a custom Tensorflow(lite) model | - | ‚úÖ 
Find an instructive Google Colab on custom model training | Google created many TFLite Google Colabs back around 2020, sadly none of them worked in the cloud | ‚ùé
Install the tflite-model-maker package | Couldn't install it because it needed ScaNN, which is only for x86 processors, found a workaround using Kali Linux using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) | ‚úÖ
Train and Validate a TFLite model | The model wasn't very good and had 100% accuracy, see pictures below | üÜó
Install OpenCV and Tensorflow for Python 3.7 on the RPi 3 (2023) | Dependency hell is real and there is no greater test of patience than that, but I won after I think a month | ‚úÖ
Deploy the model and perform inferencing | Crummy model produced crummy results. Also it ran at low single digit fps and detected nothing | üÜó
Put everything together (2023) | Bad model, poor performance, didn't implement recording functionality and dropped project | ‚ùé
\- | **Hiatus** | -
Start project back up | I cannot run main.py and OpenCV is generating a slew of errors | ‚ùé
Install different Python versions to fix OpenCV | Some Python builds broke altogether and others failed to install OpenCV | ‚ùé
\- | **Hiatus** | -
Start project back up again | Still can't run main.py and OpenCV continues to malfunction | üÜó
Install different Python versions to fix OpenCV | Success! Kind of. Python 3.9.2 and opencv-python==4.5.5.64 work, but now Numpy is having issues | üÜó
Install different Python versions to fix Numpy | Success! Now I can't install OpenCV! | üÜó
3D print a stand for the camera and a fan | Thank you Skibidi Labib <3 | ‚úÖ
Look into PyTorch for object detection | - | ‚úÖ
Install PyTorch | pip can't find PyTorch | ‚ùé
Abandon Tensorflow and Pytorch | Both ML libraries are built for 64-bit systems and mine is a 32-bit system, and they run like crud anyways | ‚úÖ
Install OpenCV again | Flashed a new 64-bit Raspbian image onto the Pi and installed OpenCV for Python 3.9.2 | ‚úÖ
Set static IP address for RPi | - | ‚úÖ
Set up X11 forwarding for remote viewing of OpenCV video feed | holy crap I can't believe this worked, I almost opened a new can of worms looking at qt.qpa plugins for solutions... thank God this works |  ‚úÖ
Adjust X11 forwarding to update feed faster and not tamper with FPS | not necessary in retrospect, this was just for debugging | ‚ùé
Add motion detection algorithm | in progress | -
Add automated recording | in progress | -
